# Mansion

An open-source game project created to have fun and learn about Python and game development.

It is (will be) a text-based adventure game with text parser built from parsimonious, using a parsing expression grammar to interpret commands from the console.

The initial idea is somewhat ambitious, so the scale of the project is still under review.  The initial idea was to create a horror-inspired game with shifting objectives and enemies, but as it is a first project, may end up smaller in scope (perhaps built up over time).
